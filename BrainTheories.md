Brain Theories Rated By Importance
==================================
1. One learning algorithm in the brain
   - Support: 
     + google "Roe et al., 1992"
       - Summary: If you cut the wires from the ear to the auditory cortex and rewire the optic nerve to the
       auditory cortex, then the auditory cortex learns to see. 
     + google "Metin & Frost, 1989"
       - Summary: If you make the wires from the optic nerve connect to the somatosensory cortex then the 
       somatosensory cortex learns to see.
   - Reasoning: If different parts of the neocortex (contains auditory cortex, somatosensory, and others..)
   can be given new input and learn to process this new input, then we can guess there is a single learning 
   algorithm in all parts of the neocortex.
