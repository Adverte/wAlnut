Brain Theories Numbered By Importance
=====================================
1. One learning algorithm in the neocortex of the brain
   - Reasoning: If different parts of the neocortex (contains auditory cortex, somatosensory, and others..)
                can be given new input and learn to process this new input, then we can guess there is a single 
                learning algorithm in all parts of the neocortex.

     + google "Roe et al., 1992" to find paper
       - Summary: If you cut the wires from the ear to the auditory cortex and rewire the optic nerve to the
                  auditory cortex, then the auditory cortex learns to see. 
     + google "Metin & Frost, 1989" to find paper
       - Summary: If you make the wires from the optic nerve connect to the somatosensory cortex then the 
                  somatosensory cortex learns to see.

2. Orientation selectivity is learned & muscle movement is crucial for this process
   - Reasoning: Reality creates a representation in your brain as neuron activity which creates muscle movement(within the eyes,
   				arms, other muscles) causing the next image to appear on your retina to be predictable by the temporal pooling
   				algorithm in your neocortex. As you continue to see, columns in your neocortex become tuned to specific directions
   				and phases.

       - Summary: 
         + Methods: Kittens where raised in either a horizontally or vertically stripped environment for five hours per 
                    day for five months. The environments forced the kitten's to only look forward at vertical stripes or horizontal
                    stripes. The remaining 19 hours each day the kittens were raised in darkness.
         + Results: At five months the kittens were tested for line recognition. Those kittens raised in horizontal environments
                    could not detect vertical aligned objects, and vice-versa.

3. Spatial pooling, sequence memory, & temporal pooling are deduced properties that are occurring
   in the human neocortex layers 3 & 4 in a similar form.
   - Spatial Pooling = creates a sparse distributed representation activity of columns to efficiently represent 
                       a larger input layer
   - Sequence Memory = create even more sparse encoding by forcing specific neurons(within the set of active columns
                       produced by spatial pooling) that best predicted the input to become "learning neurons"
   - Temporal Pooling =

4. Information flow in the brain
   - Path 1) synapseOnAxonOfNeuronA -> dendriteOfNeuronB -> cellBodyOfNeuronB -> axonOfNeuronB -> synapseOfNeuronC
   - Path 2) Read somewhere that dendrites can also be output devices to synapses(cellBody -> dendrite -> synapse). Find
             support.

5. The majority of what we call intelligence is developed during the first 2 years of life
   - Reasoning: About 10^14 synapses in the brain by 2 years of age. About 10^8 seconds in 2 years. That means about 
                10^6 synapses are formed per second in a fetus and infant.
