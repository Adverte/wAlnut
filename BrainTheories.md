Brain Theories Numbered By Importance
=====================================
1. One learning algorithm in the neocortex of the brain
   - Support: 
     + google "Roe et al., 1992" to find paper
       - Summary: If you cut the wires from the ear to the auditory cortex and rewire the optic nerve to the
                  auditory cortex, then the auditory cortex learns to see. 
     + google "Metin & Frost, 1989" to find paper
       - Summary: If you make the wires from the optic nerve connect to the somatosensory cortex then the 
                  somatosensory cortex learns to see.
   - Reasoning: If different parts of the neocortex (contains auditory cortex, somatosensory, and others..)
                can be given new input and learn to process this new input, then we can guess there is a single 
                learning algorithm in all parts of the neocortex.

2. Orientation selectivity is learned & muscle movement is crucial for this process
   - Support: 
     + Blakemore, C. & Cooper, G.F. (1970)
       - Summary: 
         + Methods: Kittens where raised in either a horizontally or vertically stripped environment for five hours per 
                    day for five months. The environments forced the kitten's to only look forward at vertical stripes or horizontal
                    stripes. The remaining 19 hours each day the kittens were raised in darkness.
         + Results: At five months the kittens were tested for line recognition. Those kittens raised in horizontal environments
                    could not detect vertical aligned objects, and vice-versa.
   - Reasoning: Reality creates a representation in your brain as neuron activity which creates muscle movement(within the eyes,
   				arms, other muscles) causing the next image to appear on your retina to be predictable by the temporal pooling
   				algorithm in your neocortex. As you continue to see, columns in your neocortex become tuned to specific directions
   				and phases. 

3. Information flow in Brain
   - Support:
   - synapseOnAxonOfNeuronA -> dendriteOfNeuronB -> cellBodyOfNeuronB -> axonOfNeuronB -> synapseOfNeuronC

4. The majority of what we call intelligence is developed during the first 2 years of life
   - Support: 
   - Reasoning: About 10^14 synapses in the brain by 2 years of age. About 10^8 seconds in 2 years. That means about 
                10^6 synapses are formed per second in a fetus and infant.

5. Spatial Pooling efficiently stores sensory information as the activation of a fixed set of neurons in sequence in a hierarchy.
   - Support:
   - Experimental Data:
