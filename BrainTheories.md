Brain Theories Numbered By Importance
=====================================
1. One learning algorithm in the neocortex of the brain
   - Support: 
     + google "Roe et al., 1992"
       - Summary: If you cut the wires from the ear to the auditory cortex and rewire the optic nerve to the
       auditory cortex, then the auditory cortex learns to see. 
     + google "Metin & Frost, 1989"
       - Summary: If you make the wires from the optic nerve connect to the somatosensory cortex then the 
       somatosensory cortex learns to see.
   - Reasoning: If different parts of the neocortex (contains auditory cortex, somatosensory, and others..)
   can be given new input and learn to process this new input, then we can guess there is a single learning 
   algorithm in all parts of the neocortex.

2. Information flow in Brain
   - Support:
   - synapseOnAxonOfNeuronA -> dendriteOfNeuronB -> cellBodyOfNeuronB -> axonOfNeuronB -> synapseOfNeuronC

3. The majority of what we call intelligence is developed during the first 2 years of life
   - Support: 
   - Reasoning: About 10^14 synapses in the brain by 2 years of age. About 10^8 seconds in 2 years. That means about 10^6 synapses are formed per second in a fetus and infant.

4. Consciousness partially exists through the LIMITED neural circuits for smell. Does olfaction pass through the thalamus?
