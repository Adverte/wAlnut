 * This is an experimental SDR algorithm that is the same as SDRAlgorithm_1
 * with the addition of local inhibition before SDR generation.
 *
 * The core idea of this algorithm is that it finds a FIXED percentage of the
 * most active columns and this is the Region's SDR. It also strengthens the
 * connections of synapses to active input cells and weakens the connections
 * of synapses to inactive input cells.
