WalnutIQRepository
==================

Hi and welcome to my brain simulation research repository in Java! This repository contains 
the model classes, utility classes, and training examples on digits for implementing a 
hierarchical temporal and spatial memory model of a human neocortex. If you are interested 
in working on this challenging and exciting project please contact quinnliu@vt.edu and 
visit "Brain Simulation Research" under "PROJECTS" at www.walnutiq.com for more information. 
Have a nice day!
