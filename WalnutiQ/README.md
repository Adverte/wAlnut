    Hi and welcome to my brain simulation research repository in Java! 
    This repository contains classes that will allow you to build your own
    brain model, train it on data, view it's activity on the console, and
    test it's ability to recognize objects.
  </p>
  <p>
    The two main model classes for this project are SpatialPooler and 
    TemporalPooler. The SpatialPooler class contains an algorithm that allows
    your brain model(object of Region class) to learn what a particular object
    is. The TemporalPooler class is still in the process of being implemented 
    and tested. When completed, it's algorithm will allow your brain model
    to predict future data after being trained on a sequence of data.
   </p>
   <p> 
    Most importantly, my research is made possible by the countless neuroscientists
    and engineers at Numenta(www.Numenta.com). Numenta has designed a exciting 
    new technology that accurately models the human neocortex(the part of the 
    brain that makes you intelligent). They have generously released the 
    pseudocode for their algorithms and this repository is my implementation of
    their algorithms.
