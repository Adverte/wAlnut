==================

Hi and welcome to my brain simulation research repository in Java! 
This repository contains the model classes, utility classes, and training 
examples on digits for implementing a hierarchical temporal and spatial memory 
model of a human neocortex. 

File tree:
src
 -model = all model classes for spatial and temporal algorithm ood implementation
   -theory = uses SpatialPooler class to build a object recognition method
   -util = provides methods for viewing the model on console and saving the model
tests
 -model = test classes for all model classes
   -theory = test classes for all theory classes
inputData
 -spatialPooler
   -vision = numbers zero to three as bitmaps
train
 -spatialPooler
   -vision = any saved trained brain models through serialization

If you are interested in working on this 
challenging and exciting project please contact quinnliu@vt.edu and 
visit "Brain Simulation Research" under "PROJECTS" at www.walnutiq.com 
for more information. Have a nice day!
